flaw during mini game dev:
	bug: attach & detach child to parent changes position.
	cant edit entity-name in editor
	too zoomed in
	lol - all entities are really stored entities
	nasty error on attching component and saving it.
	shift+R collides with typing capital R
	saving entity to storage doesnt make it an instance to the new stored type
	removing rocket from storage
	got entity got its components reversed

diverse:
	safety regarding deletion (er du sikker eller auto backups eller undo)
	literals should evt. store uuids not names
	colliders are not very visible when selected

Editor 
	
	Inspector
		evt. macros to show variables
		evt. edit polygon positions in scene by dragging.
	SceneEditor
		evt. run button
		evt. show clidren of selection
		evt. click + move in one action by clicking on entity and moving it
		evt. selection priority (evt. automated by picking parents over children)
		evt. cut, copy, paste, by ctrl+(x, c, v)
		evt. select children too by ctrl+a
		goto selection by ctrl+F (steps through selection)
	GameView
		allow fullscreen mode
	Hierarchy	
		evt. show entities with errors in hierachy (provided that components have some way of reporting errors)
		evt. select increment and select range by ctrl+click and shift+click
		evt. open-close children too by alt-click or perhaps ctrl + double click
		evt. reorder hierachy by ctrl + up/down
	evt. AssetFolder
	evt. Console
