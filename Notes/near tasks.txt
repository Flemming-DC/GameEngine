performance:
	evt. rename Time::Now() to Time::ThisFrame() or Time::Frame()
	turn vSync back on when done with performance
	use && over repeated if in Bounds overlap check

flaw during mini game dev:
	OnStart mixes OnStart, OnGameStart and OnEngineStart
	evt. HotKeyList (or action menu in hierachy)
	evt. ensure that { filenames } == { names in naming } in NamingSaver
	parenting is handled incorrectly by stored entities. You ought store children, not parents.
	missing sound
	select by non-visiable renderable is annoying

diverse:
	safety regarding deletion (er du sikker eller auto backups eller undo)

	colliders are not very visible when selected
	LargerThan / LessThen -> Longer / Shorter
	allow deletion while mouse in hierachy
	allow shift select-range in hierachy
	dublicate parent-child relationships, when dublicating hierachy
