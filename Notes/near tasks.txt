flaw during mini game dev:
	bug: attach & detach child to parent changes position.
	cant edit entity-name in editor
	too zoomed in
	lol - all entities are really stored entities
	nasty error on attching component and saving it.
	shift+R collides with typing capital R
	saving entity to storage doesnt make it an instance to the new stored type
	removing rocket from storage
	got entity got its components reversed
	missing interpolate 2d angles & positions
	activation / deactivation of components required for smoothing flames.
	X in corner doesnt close editor
	how to properly edit storedEntities?
	collider lacks offset
	clicking another object in hierachy should remove the old selection unless shift-clicking 
	delay::ForSeconds(duration, function)
	initOrder: loop over comptype then entities vs loop over entities then compType.
	setting up dependencies during loading gives problems
	staredEntities new random new ids for their comps. This destroys references
	OnStart mixes OnGameStart with OnEngineStart
	show errormessage when attempting to delete stored components on stored entity.
	

diverse:
	safety regarding deletion (er du sikker eller auto backups eller undo)
	literals should evt. store uuids not names
	colliders are not very visible when selected
	LargerThan / LessThen -> Longer / Shorter
