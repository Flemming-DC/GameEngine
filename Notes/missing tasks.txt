diverse
	buy old used mac, linux, xbox and playstation
	update view-area on window resize
	error handling ved uninitialized material / mesh (the !UuidCreator::IsInitialized(id) check didn't catch missing setup call) (probably due to trying to read material from disk)
	copy res automatically to build folder, and provide a better error messages if res is missing. 
	cleanup Get prefixes
	store all special folders in some const variables
	2D lighting
	apply standard math checks everywhere in debug collision2D
	prune away super close cornes in polygon collider and then check that positionCount in polygon collider is at least 3. 
	evt. add material types
	destroying an object can chrash the manual setup. 
	possible bug: openGL only have 32 textureIDs at the same time (texture atlasses can help)
	evt. move entity name into the transform class and apply uniqueness of entity-names inside a given parent. (and in root)
	bug: sceneCamera move speed and scrolling got out of sync
	provide valid default state for colliders
	


components & gameobjects
	handle activation
	asset instances / prefabs (implement them by function calls that create an entity)
	uninitialized components for the sake of the gameLogic
	introduce ordering of start function. call it first on builtin components, then on others
	remove entity from register upon destruction.
	

dynamics
	enable, disable
	should OnGameStart be called every time you press "run game" in the editor? 
	onRareUpdate, OnTimedStart/OnStart overload with int parameter

Editor
	Hierarchy	

collision
	broad phase: boundingbox trees
	collision solving (aka. interaction)
	evt. drag & friction

	components
		rigidbody
	generate collision data
		normals, velocity, collisionPoint

read/save files from/to disk
	comments in yml files for uuids (e.g. path as comment)
	load mesh and material from id

input:
	evt. icons
	evt. pass float input trough a function that makes them more linear
	evt. scale input by passing a float to InputAction.AddKey


profiler 
	libery (I think there is one called optic)

make 2d game

particle systems ?
