	buy old used mac, linux, xbox and playstation
	update view-area on window resize
	put solid color shader in engine
	introduce check for unwanted destruction and for creation before openGL init

	separate gamelogic out
	updatable
	handle activation
	asset instances
	component destroyed warning

dynamics
	startObject, endObject, update, enable, disable, startScene, endScene, starGame, endGame

collision
	use constrained proportions for circleCollider. this proporty is set on transform and used
	by circleCollider and Gizmo renderer
	edit colliders

	collision detection
		broad phase: boundingbox trees
	collision solving (aka. interaction)
	evt. drag & friction
	
	easy spawning for testing

	components
		rigidbody
	generate collision data
		normals, velocity, collisionPoint

scenes
run function / master loop
read/save files from/to disk

headers
	common, tools, rendering
