diverse
	buy old used mac, linux, xbox and playstation
	update view-area on window resize
	error handling ved uninitialized material / mesh (the !UuidCreator::IsInitialized(id) check didn't catch missing setup call) (probably due to trying to read material from disk)
	input keyPressed and keyReleased bools and events.
	copy res automatically to build folder, and provide a better error messages if res is missing. 
	cleanup Get prefixes
	store any special folders in const


components & gameobjects
	handle activation
	asset instances / prefabs (implement them by function calls that create an entity)
	uninitialized components for the sake of the gameLogic
	introduce ordering of start function. call it first on builtin components, then on others
	remove entity from register upon destruction.
	

dynamics
	enable, disable
	should OnGameStart be called every time you press "run game" in the editor? 
	onRareUpdate, OnTimedStart/OnStart overload with int parameter

Editor
	ctrl input for saving
	save changes automatically and/or on ctrl+s
	seperate core loop into editor vs game and evt. also seperate game-in-editor from game-in-build
	turn Renderer::SetupGrid2D(0.25f); off in gameView (nb: this line is inside Scene::ActivateImmediately)

	Inspector
	SceneEditor / Viewport
		run button width shortcut
		resize
		selection: single, box, evt. type
		move camera and objects by wasd/arrows and by mouse click+drag (without conflict)
		pause game in viewport
		save scene automatically
	GameView
		bring default window up in front of ImGUI and put in focus 
		run game on play and reload scene on stop
	AssetFolder
	Hierarchy	
	viewport

collision
	use constrained proportions for circleCollider. this proporty is set on transform and used by circleCollider and Gizmo renderer
	edit colliders
	broad phase: boundingbox trees
	collision solving (aka. interaction)
	evt. drag & friction
	easy spawning for testing

	components
		rigidbody
	generate collision data
		normals, velocity, collisionPoint

read/save files from/to disk
	comments in yml files for uuids (e.g. path as comment)
	load mesh and material from id
	

headers
	common, tools, rendering
profiler

make 2d game


flaws (wont fix)
	creating a collider Gizmo before the grid Gizmo causes the former to show up incorrectly.
