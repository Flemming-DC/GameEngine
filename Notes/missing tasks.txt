diverse
	move openGL errorhandling into rendering folder thereby seperating it from general tools
	set uniform should act on separate material instances, not shared materials.
	generational indices or uuid's over pointers to components and entities
	camera scroll
	buy old used mac, linux, xbox and playstation

components & gameobjects
	separate gamelogic out
	updatable
	handle activation
	asset instances

dynamics
	startObject, endObject, update, enable, disable, startScene, endScene, starGame, endGame

collision
	use constrained proportions for circleCollider. this proporty is set on transform and used
	by circleCollider and Gizmo renderer

	collision detection
		broad phase: boundingbox trees
	collision solving (aka. interaction)
	evt. drag & friction
	
	easy spawning for testing
	raycast and the like

	components
		collider
		rigidbody
	generate collision data
		normals, velocity, colliders, exit vs enter
	collision events, not callbacks for exit/enter. bool for stay
	isTouching evt. with errorbar

scenes
run function / master loop
read/save files from/to disk

threads
headers
	common, tools, rendering
