optimizations:
	transform O(n^2) function
	batch rendering 
	parralization
	physics broad phase
	contigous memory for 
		textures, matrials, objects in scenes, 
		transforms, renderables, colliders, custom components
	collisionStatic and collisionLayers
	CalculateShadowAlongNormal is expensive for polygon collider. evt. use some form of precalculation
	use broadShadow in raycast as a broadPhase
	activation / enabling of entities and components
